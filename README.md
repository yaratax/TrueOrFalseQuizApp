# True or False Quiz in C#

This C# software uses arrays and loops to create a true or false quiz. It asks the user a series of questions, validates their answers, calculates the score, and shows the outcome.

## Code Explanations

### Setup:

- 'questions': An array of true and false questions.
- 'answers': An array containing the right answers for the questions.
-'replies': An array containing the user's responses.

### Asking Questions

1. The program loops through each question in the 'questions' array.
2. For each question, it prompts the user for input and checks if it can be transformed to a boolean value ('true' or 'false'). If the input is invalid, it will continuously prompt the user to submit a proper response until one is supplied.
3. The user's response is saved in the'responses' array.

### Calculating Scores

1. The software compares each user response recorded in the'responses' array to the right answer contained in the 'answers' array.
2. The score increases with each accurate response.

### Displaying the Result

- After assessing all replies, the computer prints each user response along with the right solution.
- Finally, it displays the user's score based on the total number of questions.

## Usage

1. Run the software.
2. Respond to each question with 'true' or 'false' as asked.
3. Review the final score.

## Notes:

- To avoid issues, ensure that the 'questions' and 'answers' arrays have the same length.
- If there is a difference in array lengths, a warning message will appear.
